## Compendium

You want to keep track of the spells existing from the different schools of magic and, as a added bonus, being able to create spellbooks containing the spells known and studied by a specific wizard.

You must be able to create new spells (name, school, level and description) which can be written on several spellbooks, look for an specific spell from the database or show all the spells on a specific book. You should be able to add and remove spells from different books as well. Books should contain a name and the list of spells contained on the book.
